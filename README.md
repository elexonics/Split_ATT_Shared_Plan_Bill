How to find the numbers:
Download your pdf monthly statement from your AT&T online account, then usually on the first page there is a section of summary of total expenses for each line in your group.  
This is where you get all the phone numbers, and the expense for each line. If your group has no extra usage than the plan-coverage, i.e. no additional data package, no international calls, etc. this month's owner's expense is the owner basic expense, and expenses of other lines should be the same and are the member basic expense.  

For example, the basic pricing are as follows,  
	Group owner basic is 104.54, including member basic and group addition  
	Group member basic is 19.39  
So the average basic for each is 27.905, the average group addition per person is 8.515  

If there exists any over usage, will lead to extra fees, works as follows,  
	Data over usage: fees applied to the owners, need to split with actual over-user  
  Other over usage & extra service:  
1) if applied to individual, counts towards him/herself's total  
-->>2) if applied to owner, need calc manually
